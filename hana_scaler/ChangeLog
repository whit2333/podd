	Modifications to hana_scaler (latest at top)
	============================

        July 12, 2008
        =============

	Makefile  added standalone codes for bigbite, Qasy feedback.

        scaler.map    updated

        THaScaler    add bigbite scalers
                  Fix bug: if crate length zero don't decode ev* scalers.
                  support to normalize by current
                  misc small diffs to ADAQ version (e.g. variable names)

	THaScalerDB   Fix bug: if crate tied to another, use it's short names.
                      (affected ev* "default" list in THaOutput)
	
        THaScalerGui     provision to norm. by current. 
                         improved help dialog.

	Added:
        tscalbbite_main.C    test code for bigbite 
        tscalbad_main.C      test code for 'bad' data (fails G0 sequence)

        tscalgui_main.C      update for bigbite
                             (backward compatible)

        tscalhist_main.C   slightly better ADAQ version
	tscalntup_main.C   slightly better ADAQ version

        Note: The ADAQ version had a plethora of "std::" in the
	THaScaler.C and THaScalerDB.C implementation, but these were
	not in the CVS version.  I decided to stick with the CVS version,
        as it is more readable.  Implementation uses namespace std.

        ============
	
        1. scaler.map modifications.  
          a) Parsing of "DATE" is more intelligent.
          b) Can tie scalers of different helicities or crates together
             (fewer repititious lines in scaler.map file)
          c) New feature of "directives" (backward compatible since
             old code will ignore them).  Accomplishes 1b and 4 below.

        3. Obsoleted THaNormScaler and THaScalerBank classes
	   (simplifies the code).

        4) THaScalerGui (used by xscaler) driven by scaler.map
           but with sensible defaults of scaler.map absent.

	Jan 20, 2002
        ============

	THaScaler.C  and .h  
	Added the RCS and synchronous scalers (roc9, roc11, etc).

	THaScalerGui.C and .h
	"scaler" is now a member, instead of inherited.  Solved compilation
	problems in Ole's released version.

	scaler.map  - updated.
