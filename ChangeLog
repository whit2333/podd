2008-09-15 11:43  ole

	* src/: THaVhist.C, THaVhist.h: Merge bugfix from trunk: crash on

	* src/THaFormula.h: Set kMAXCODES to TFormula::kMAXFOUND (currently
	  500) for consistency.

2007-12-06 16:50  ole

	* src/THaFormula.C: Fix bug introduced with the last change that
	  caused expression that contain a mix of string and value
	  variables to return incorrect results in many cases. This is
	  partly a workaround some pretty poor programming in TFormula.

2007-11-30 19:44  ole

	* Makefile: Version is 1.4.9

2007-11-30 19:26  ole

	* src/: THaCut.C, THaFormula.C, THaFormula.h: Add support for
	  strings defined by global variables of Char_t* type.	If such
	  variables are used outside of a string context, they fall back to
	  the previous behavior (pointer to signed byte-sized integer).

2007-11-19 18:36  ole

	* src/THaVform.C: Fix crash on exiting analyzer if multiple
	  THaVform objects with identical names are defined (as can happen
	  easily when defining multiple histograms with the same expression
	  for one of the axes, for example).

2007-07-24 14:25  ole

	* Makefile: Version is 1.4.7

2007-07-24 14:24  ole

	* src/THaAnalysisObject.C: Pick up bugfix for missing '=' in

	* src/THaOutput.C: Fix typo (forgotten ++) in Print().

2007-04-20 00:11  ole

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: Restore signature of
	  InitModules() to stay binary-compatible (probably paranoid).

2007-04-19 23:46  ole

	* src/THaAnalysisObject.C: Cowardly refuse to initialize zombies.

2007-04-19 17:35  ole

	* src/: THaDecData.C, THaDecData.h: Protect against more than one
	  instance of THaDecData being created because of static data used
	  by VdcEff().

2007-04-19 17:08  ole

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: When initializing, check for
	  and remove zombie modules from the modules lists.

2007-04-18 16:31  ole

	* src/: THaDecData.C, THaDecData.h: - Fix Init() to support
	  intelligent reinitialization.    Changing crate/slot definitions
	  for existing	variables as well as	new definitions are
	  handled, but removing variables through    reinitialization is
	  currently not possible (probably indicates user error    anyway).
	  Should probably print a warning in that case - TBD.  - Improve
	  efficiency of Decode() and VdcEff(). Still more improvement
	  possible.  - Other minor improvements (C++ iterators, local loop
	  variables, Print()).

2007-04-14 01:23  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: - Improvements: 1) Fix uninitialized data member
	  fData of THaScalerKey. This caused	scaler data in the
	  event-by-event tree to be junk up until the	 first scaler
	  event.  2) Don't add variables that are used in formulas to the
	  tree if they	  are already there. This cased some variables to
	  appear twice (or more!)    in the tree in many cases, depending
	  on formula definitions.

	  - Fix bug introduced in prior revision (typo) that prevented
	  formula variables to be added to the tree altogether.
	  Interestingly,   this made no difference when drawing the
	  formulas, so it looks like   the old ROOT bug that motivated this
	  feature has been fixed and the   adding of variables can now be
	  skipped (perhaps if a sufficiently   recent ROOT version is
	  detected). To be done.

	  - More minor code cleanup (preference for STL iterators over
	  array   indices, efficiency mods).

2007-04-14 01:08  ole

	* src/THaOutput.h: Remove unused #includes.  Pass arguments of some
	  internal functions more efficiently.

2007-04-13 15:13  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: Turn benchmarking off for production version.

2007-04-13 14:58  ole

	* Makefile: Version is 1.4.5

2007-04-13 14:46  ole

	* src/: THaOutput.C, THaOutput.h: Bugfix: Update the branch address
	  when resizing THaOdata array.  This bug was the reason for the
	  different output file size after speeding up the code.
	  Fortunately, the speed improvement remains even with this fix.
	  Also, move less time-critical THaOdata functions into
	  implementation file.

2007-04-13 12:10  ole

	* src/THaVform.C: Replace two more occurrences of
	  std::vector::size() with call to empty(), which is much faster.
	  Add some comments.

2007-04-13 12:08  ole

	* src/: THaOutput.C, THaOutput.h: Remove unneeded includes. Add
	  some comments.

2007-04-13 12:05  ole

	* src/THaVform.h: Merge implementations of IsEye() etc. inlines
	  with the declarations for better readability.

2007-04-13 01:22  ole

	* src/: THaVhist.C, THaVhist.h: Minor mods in order to improve
	  performance - not much difference.  Inline CheckCut().

2007-04-13 01:21  ole

	* src/THaVar.h: Move GetLen() etc. functions up so they get inlined
	  in GetValueAsDouble().

2007-04-13 01:19  ole

	* src/: THaVform.C, THaVform.h: Performance improvements: Replace
	  the string comparisons in functions IsEye() etc. with a simple
	  integer test. Requires a different type for the fType member
	  variable, resulting in binary incompatibility - probably not an
	  issue since this is basically an internal class. Rewrite
	  Process() to use fType directly. Inline GetData().

2007-04-13 01:11  ole

	* src/THaOutput.h: Make the size of THaOdata objects variable. No
	  longer zero out the THaOdata data array in Clear(). This is not
	  necessary because THaOutput always fills the full index range
	  from 0 to ndata-1 without gaps.  These two changes give a major
	  speed improvement and also, surprisingly, a significant reduction
	  of the output file size (output file data consistency to be
	  verified, but all data seems to be there at first glance).

2007-04-13 01:03  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: Add benchmarking code for performance
	  evaluation.  For loops over STL vectors, use iterators, not
	  indexing (better type safety).  Loop backwards when "Fill"ing
	  THaOdata objects to minimize the need for resizing them.

2007-04-13 00:53  ole

	* src/THaFormula.C: Return kBig if invalid expression etc., not
	  zero.  Fix the return code in case no variable list is found so
	  that evaluation stops.

2007-04-11 14:57  ole

	* Makefile: Version is 1.4.4.

2007-04-11 14:53  ole

	* src/THaDecData.h: Merge string matching fix from trunk (version
	  1.9).

2007-04-05 15:02  ole

	* Makefile: When "install"ing, also copy THaNormAna source code to
	  $ANALYZER/src/src.  Let ha_compiledata.h depend on Makefile again
	  (was accidentally commented out).

2007-04-05 00:15  ole

	* Makefile: Install Makefile and ChangeLog in $(ANALYZER)/src.

2007-04-04 23:33  ole

	* Makefile: Add install target.  Version is 1.4.3

2007-04-04 23:32  ole

	* hana_decode/Makefile, hana_scaler/Makefile: Remove direct copy of
	  shared lib to $ANALYZER lib dir in install target.  Now handled
	  by top-level Makefile.

2007-04-04 15:31  ole

	* src/THaDecData.C: Changed hardcoded cuts "cutlo" and "cuthi"
	  according to undocumented modification on adaq. I guess I'll
	  never understand why anyone has the nerve to compile
	  hardware-dependent parameters into production code.  I'll throw
	  this stuff out in 1.5.

2007-04-04 13:58  ole

	* Makefile, src/NormAna_LinkDef.h, src/THaNormAna.h: Compile
	  THaNormAna class and make it available as a plug-in library.

2007-04-04 13:01  ole

	* src/: THaNormAna.C, THaNormAna.h: Update to the version from the
	  online account (from Bob): Add support for helicity
	  (unfinished?). Drop support for bcm_d10.

2007-04-02 16:15  ole

	* src/THaInterface.C: If $ANALYZER set, use it for setting ROOT's
	  IncludePath, else fall back to the old logic of using the
	  compile-time directories.

2007-03-29 00:11  ole

	* src/THaInterface.C: To work around the non-portability of TDatime
	  and localtime(), fix the timezone to "US/Eastern" for now. This
	  is good for all JLab production data.  This will be fixed
	  properly in Release 1.5 by using TTimeStamp or similar.

2007-03-27 14:46  ole

	* src/: THaSecondaryKine.C, THaSecondaryKine.h: As with
	  THaPrimaryKine, define global variables of vector components via
	  function calls instead of storing them in redundant member
	  variables.  Keep those variables around for now for binary
	  compatibility.

2007-03-26 16:36  ole

	* Makefile, src/HallA_LinkDef.h, src/THaPhotoReaction.C,
	  src/THaPhotoReaction.h, src/THaSAProtonEP.C, src/THaSAProtonEP.h:
	  New physics modules from LEDEX: 1) THaPhotoReaction calculates
	  Egamma for deuteron photodisintegration, gamma(d,p)n 2)
	  THaSAProtonEP calculates electron kinematics for ELASTIC
	  p(e,p)e', when the proton is detected instead of the electron.

2007-03-26 16:31  ole

	* src/: THaPrimaryKine.C, THaPrimaryKine.h: * Clear the 4-vectors,
	  too, when doing Clear().  * No longer fill fQx etc. - these data
	  can be obtained with a simple   function call on fQ, even when
	  defining global variables. Keep them around	as member variables
	  around for now for binary compatibility.

2007-03-26 16:29  ole

	* src/THaAnalysisObject.C: Clear() the object after successful
	  Init().

2007-03-26 14:07  ole

	* src/: THaAnalysisObject.C, THaAnalysisObject.h: Update to head of
	  trunk (text = 1.20, header = 1.13)

2007-03-23 16:24  ole

	* Makefile, gcc-version: Remove test for gcc version >= 3. This (as
	  well as a test for the ROOT version) should be done in a
	  configure script.  Version is 1.4.3pre.

2007-03-23 16:20  ole

	* src/THaSecondaryKine.C: Remove workaround for TRotation and bump
	  system requirements to ROOT 3.05/07.

2007-03-23 13:57  ole

	* src/Ext_TRotation.h: Restored.

2007-03-23 13:55  ole

	* src/Ext_TRotation.h: Accidentally removed.

2007-03-23 12:44  ole

	* src/: THaBeamEloss.C, THaTrackEloss.C: Remove redundant check for
	  initialization of input in Init(). FindModule() already does
	  this.

2007-03-21 15:19  ole

	* src/: THaRunBase.C, THaRunParameters.C: A more descriptive error
	  message is printed if run information is missing at
	  initialization time and the run cannot be fully initialized.
	  Move initialization of new run parameter onject into
	  THaRunParameter constructor.

2007-03-21 13:15  ole

	* src/THaElossCorrection.C: Better error messages for missing
	  material paraemeters in run database.

2007-03-21 13:14  ole

	* src/THaExtTarCor.C: Define global variables via
	  THaTrackingModule's self-describing interface, as with the other
	  tracking module clients.

2007-03-21 13:13  ole

	* src/: THaBeamEloss.C, THaTrackEloss.C: Explicitly scope call to
	  GetRVarDef in DefineVariables to avoid possible future ambiguity.

2007-03-21 13:11  ole

	* src/: THaAvgVertex.C, THaReacPointFoil.C, THaReactionPoint.C,
	  THaTwoarmVertex.C, THaVertexModule.C, THaVertexModule.h: Make
	  THaVertexModule self-describe its global variables, in the same
	  way as THaBeamModule and THaTrackingModule.

2007-03-21 10:58  ole

	* src/THaTrackEloss.C: Init() now ensures that input tracking
	  module has a good spectrometer, (analogous to THaBeamEloss).
	  Define global variables using the self-describing interface
	  rather than explicitly.

2007-03-21 10:50  ole

	* src/THaTrackInfo.h: Bugfix: fSpectro was not copied by copy
	  constructor.

2007-03-21 10:50  ole

	* src/: THaTrackingModule.C, THaTrackingModule.h: Add GetRVarDef()
	  function analogous to THaBeamModule. Allows clients to define
	  global variables on this class without dependence on its layout.

2007-03-21 10:44  ole

	* src/THaBeamEloss.C: Prevent crash if input beam module not found.
	  Print error message if the input beam module does not have a
	  good beam apparatus.

2007-03-20 17:28  ole

	* src/THaBeamEloss.C: Fix another initialization bug: Save pointer
	  to parent beam apparatus already at initialization time. Without
	  this, chains of THaBeamEloss modules fail to initialize.

2007-03-19 13:49  ole

	* src/THaSecondaryKine.C: Clarify and correct comments regarding
	  missing energy and mass.

2007-02-07 13:01  ole

	* Makefile: Version is 1.4.2

2007-02-07 12:51  ole

	* src/THaBeamEloss.C: Bugfix: don't test beaminfo but rather the
	  parent beam object for proper initialization. beaminfo->IsOK()
	  refers to event-by-event data, beam->IsInit() to the module
	  startup initialization, which is what we want in the Init()
	  routine here.

2007-02-07 12:49  ole

	* hana_scaler/haScal_LinkDef.h: Merge in version 1.5 from trunk,
	  which removes unneeded explicit link requests for STL instances.

2007-02-07 12:48  ole

	* src/HallA_LinkDef.h: Merge one useful patch from trunk
	  (1.40->1.41): Remove explicit link requests for STL instances.
	  These instances will be happily available from CINT/scripts if
	  ROOT is built properly (make cintdlls).

2007-02-07 12:41  ole

	* src/THaDecData.C: Clean up from previous fix: remove
	  unused/uninitialized variables in VdcEff().

2007-02-05 16:44  feuerbac

	* src/THaDecData.C: Fixes to the VDCeff calculation:  * initialize
	  all elements of xcnt, eff, and wire to 0  * separate cnt from
	  per-plane loop so all planes have their histograms	 filled in
	  the case that the number of planes factorizes 500.   * changes
	  calculation method to go as O(N) instead of O(N^3), where	 N
	  is the number of hits on a plane.

2006-09-26 15:03  ole

	* Makefile: Version is 1.4.1

2006-09-26 15:02  ole

	  Merge fixes from GEn branch: * hana_decode/THaBenchmark.h
	  (gen-e02013.1): Increase permitted   number of benchmark items *
	  hana_decode/THaCodaData.C (gen-e02013.1): Fix the 'delete'
	  operator in the destructor to 'delete []'. Stops crash (at least
	  for GEn runs) at the end of an analysis.  *
	  hana_decode/THaCodaDecoder.C (gen-e02013.3): Fix copy-and-paste
	  error when checking the prescale factor reading in from the file
	  compared to the trigger-supervisor.

2006-09-26 14:59  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: Merge fixes from GEn branch (from Rob
	  Feuerbach): Two changes to the scaler handling:   1)	Enabled the
	  "count" option for the default and default_helicity	    sets of
	  scaler variables. (could only get rate before)   2)  New "scaler"
	  variable dclock which gives the difference in clock	    count
	  for this interval, permitting one to go back from "rate" to
	  "counts" per segment.

2006-09-26 14:53  ole

	* src/THaAnalyzer.C: Better protect InitModules() against insane
	  input.

2006-09-26 13:26  ole

	* src/: THaCoincTime.C, THaS2CoincTime.C: Fix crash due to
	  incorrect dereferencing of Vxtime array.

2006-08-18 13:43  feuerbac

	* src/THaS2CoincTime.C: Fix typo to compare int, not int*.

	  print statement.

2006-07-17 15:11  ole

	  issues.

2006-07-17 14:40  ole

	* docs/RELEASE_NOTES.html: Updated for Release 1.4.

2006-07-17 14:05  ole

	  TString::Atoi() in older ROOT.

2006-07-17 13:41  ole

	* src/: THaCoincTime.C, THaS2CoincTime.C: Fix compilation failure
	  on Solaris.

	  Using references in structures is non-standard C++. Please avoid
	  GNU extensions and the like. We'd like to write portable code.

2006-07-17 13:38  ole

	* hana_scaler/: THaScalerDB.C, THaScalerDB.h: Fix name clashes with
	  member variables (again).

	  Please use the ROOT naming conventions for member data, static
	  members, functions, etc. It helps a LOT. Really.

2006-07-17 13:34  ole

	* hana_scaler/: THaScaler.C, THaScaler.h: Fix name clashes with
	  member variables (if ONLY all member variables were named
	  according to the ROOT programming guidelines, I wouldn't have to
	  fix this mess every time).

	  Proper argument for map::insert is map::value_type. Sorry, but it
	  is. Really.

	* src/: THaCut.C, THaFormula.C: Fix subtle bug introduced with a
	  change to TFormula::Analyze in ROOT 4: DefinedVariable() must now
	  return -1 if the variable is not found.  The negative return
	  values -2 and -3 will prevent further parsing of the string. (In
	  ROOT 3 and earlier, any negative return value would result in
	  further parsing.) In particular, this affected expressions like
	  "!Variable", where "Variable" was a perfectly good name.

	  in THaVDC: don't use a single plane spacing,	  but allow for
	  different spacings between U1-U2 and V1-V2.	  Original code
	  used single value (U1-U2 spacing), causing the V slopes     to be
	  off.	   This may affect tracking results! Re-optimization might
	  be necessary.   - add fLocalSlope in THaVDCCluster

	  Tracks are event-by-event data, and so we wouldn't want to write
	  them with the tracking module. Instead, disable ROOT I/O of fTrk.

	  thought is to have the apparatus (with its detectors) written
	  straight to the UserInfo header portion of a TTree.

	  The THaScintillator class is fully prepared for this now. Others
	  will follow.

	  NOTE: in order to make this work, some pointers between detectors
	  or from detector to apparatus were replaced with light-weight
	  intelligent ROOT pointer-like TRef objects. This avoids writing
	  out multiple copies of the same objects and keeps them

	  experience from looking at F1-TDCs.  Upon exiting the 767 decode
	  stage, the pointer 'p' points at the last word from the 767's,
	  such that the next iteration looks at the first 'non-767' word.

2005-08-01 14:41  feuerbac

	* src/THaAnalyzer.C: Made certain that the THaRun object gets
	  written to the 'first' root-file, and that the end-of-analysis
	  'writes' are to the current root-file. Keep in mind that ROOT can
	  automatically split a tree across multiple files, to keep the
	  filesize below a specified (default is ~2GB) limit.

	  This might fix some end-of-analysis crashes we have seen.

	  Should look into whether the fTree->Write in THaOutput is
	  actually necessary.

2005-07-29 14:06  reitz

	* src/: THaUnRasteredBeam.C, THaUnRasteredBeam.h: Added the
	  possibility to use a running average with variable depth for the
	  beampositon instead of a single BPM reading. Setting the depth to
	  zero or one (default) results in using event by event readings of
	  the BPMs (noise corresponding to 100um)

	  size_t) configurations. Thanks Doug!

2005-06-11 12:44  rom

	* hana_scaler/: THaScaler.C, scaler.map: update scaler map for
	  bigbite setup (e01015).  Also for that setup there was no
	  TS-accept plugged into the bigbite scalers, so if there is no
	  TS-accpt the default normalization slot is the one where a clock
	  is plugged in.  The code needs this to make it faster.  Probably
	  would be better to make scaler-map provide this info instead but
	  this is ok for now.

2005-06-10 07:21  rom

	* hana_scaler/THaScalerGui.C: Since THaScalerDB returns list of

	  THaScalerDB), we now need to use this here

2005-06-10 04:59  rom

	* hana_scaler/: THaScaler.C, THaScaler.h, THaScalerDB.C,
	  THaScalerDB.h: fixed a bug whereby if there were two or more
	  names in scaler.map for one channel, only one was taken (how did
	  I miss that ?).  example:  the clock may be called clock or T8.
	  Solution was to make channame a map to a vector of strings in
	  THaScalerDB and to make nomrmap a multimap of strings to int in
	  THaScaler

2005-05-13 14:00  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/THaCodaDecoder.C: Added the F1 TDC into the
	  vme_decode routine. Keep in mind that the channels for the module
	  are renumbered (to be sequential) compared to what is labelled on
	  the module itself.

	  Also made sure the vme_decode loops over all slots in a crate,
	  not just map->getNslot since the modules could be loaded into the
	  crate non-contiguously.

2005-04-21 15:53  feuerbac

	* src/: THaCherenkov.C, THaCherenkov.h: Each track now gets a
	  plane-intercept 'trx' and 'try'. Previously, these were only
	  calculated in the case of single-track events. In addition, the
	  pathlength (from the DCS origin at the VDCs) to the detector is
	  reported, which should be useful for fine-tuning
	  survival-probablity calculations.

2005-04-21 15:49  feuerbac

	* src/THaSpectrometerDetector.C: Added to the 'documenting comment'
	  of CalcTrackIntercept

	  THaVDCPlane.C, THaVDCTimeToDistConv.h, THaVDCUVTrack.C,
	  THaVDCUVTrack.h: Added track chi2 calculations to monitor the
	  quality of the track fitting.  To do this:  1) THaVDCHit had
	  fdDist (uncertainty) and ftrDist (distance from track to wire)
	   members added to it.   2) THaTrack has a new fChi2 and fNDoF
	  members   3) THaVDCCluster calculates the chi2 for each cluster
	  relative to the cluster's	 track.   4) THaVDCTimeToDistConv
	  and THaVDCAnalyticTTDConv modified to permit the passing	of
	  an uncertainty in the drift distance; right now
	  THaVDCAnalyticTTDConv      starts with a 4ns uncertainty in the
	  drift time (~200 microns).   5) THaVDC, THaVDCPlane, and
	  THaSpectrometer modified to do the call the chi2
	  calculations and define the new global variables.

	  THaVDCCluster also has a new 'FitSimpleTrackWgt' method (not used
	  now) that performs the track fitting, respecting the different
	  uncertainties in the drift distances. This method is still being
	  shaken-down.

	  Fix default slot and chananel for clock so it is easily defined
	  in scaler.map; 3) For users who unwisely have no clocks in their
	  scalers, provide a public method to input an average time
	  interval between scaler events -- for crude (10% but probably not

	* hana_decode/: THaGenDetTest.C, THaGenDetTest.h: Test code that
	  was broken when THaEvData became abstract (not that it matters
	  much, but I dont like code that doesnt compile, so we either fix
	  it or delete it)

2004-12-28 19:27  rom

	* hana_decode/: epics_main.C, prfact_main.C, tdecex_main.C,
	  tdecpr_main.C, tstio_main.C: These codes were all broken when
	  THaEvData became abstract (gee, I really thought I fixed this
	  months ago). The codes are only used by me for testing things.

2004-12-28 19:25  rom

	* hana_decode/THaEvData.C: add another ifndef for STANDALONE test
	  mode (does not matter for normal usage)

2004-12-11 20:20  rom

	* src/: THaNormAna.C, THaNormAna.h: add the synchronous scalers
	  (roc11) needed by DVCS

2004-11-30 14:25  rom

	* hana_scaler/tscalfbk_main.C: fix bugs in myatof (oops)

2004-11-17 10:47  rom

	* hana_scaler/tscalfbk_main.C: put min/max limits on IA set points

2004-11-16 12:10  rom

	* hana_scaler/tscalfbk_main.C: add system call to script that does
	  feedback; adjust the cuts; add function myatof since atof does
	  not work

2004-11-15 10:14  rom

	* hana_scaler/tscalfbk_main.C: improve the timescale for feedback
	  on qasy

2004-11-15 10:14  rom

	* hana_scaler/: THaScaler.C, THaScaler.h, THaScalerGui.C,
	  scaler.map, tscalgui_main.C: add the SRC scalers.  This is still
	  the old way to add scalers (awkward, but works).  I am still
	  working on the improvements which will make it easier... but this
	  is good enough to start SRC experiment if necessary.	The
	  standalone codes (e.g. xscaler) is already deployed on ADAQ
	  computers.

2004-11-12 10:56  feuerbac

	* src/THaAnalyzer.C: Be certain that to be in the output file
	  (fFile) during the THaOutput Init, keeping track of the previous
	  state (copying gDirectory's value).

	  We had found a case where the user was reading in simulated data
	  from a ROOT file, and so gDirectory was not pointing at the
	  correct directory during initialization, and so the tree was not
	  owned by the output file but just languished in memory until
	  analyzer->Close().

	  NOTE: the current directory is only important when CREATING a
	  TTree or TH1; you can be in any directory while ::Fill'ing it.

2004-11-11 16:54  feuerbac

	* Makefile: Add THaTrackOut, the example of direct object output to
	  the Tree.

2004-11-10 18:55  feuerbac

	* src/THaAnalysisObject.C: Req. changes to THaAnalysisObject for
	  the object output.

2004-11-10 12:42  rom

	* hana_scaler/tscalfbk_main.C: Online feedback on charge asymmetry.
	  This version just keeps a log of what it would do.  I am still
	  waiting on the EPICS hooks to finish the job

2004-11-10 10:51  feuerbac

	* src/: THaTrackOut.C, THaTrackOut.h, HallA_LinkDef.h,
	  THaAnalysisObject.h, THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: Added
	  "InitOutput" routines to THaAnalysisObject, such that detectors,
	  physics modules, etc. can easily write complete objects to the
	  standard output tree.

	  The THaTrackOut class is an example of how to do this. It writes
	  a TLorentzVector, corresponding to a track, to the tree.

2004-10-14 14:59  rom

	* docs/output.html: Explain why users should avoid the ambiguous =0
	  assignment for EPICS data string assignments.  Now lets see if
	  they ever read it.

2004-10-14 14:58  rom

	* src/THaOutput.C: Return to 0 as default data (as Rob F. wanted).
	  Hopefully users will read the documentation and avoid the
	  ambiguous =0 assignment

2004-10-14 14:19  rom

	* src/THaOutput.C: return -1e32 instead of 0 if the EPICS variable
	  string assignment was not found.  This is consistent with the
	  rest of EPICS convention of returning -1e32 for undefined.
	  Previously returned 0 which could be confusing if one had an
	  assignment like Fred=0 and found data other than Fred.

2004-10-13 15:22  rom

	* hana_scaler/: tscalevt_main.C, tscalring_main.C,
	  tscalroc11_main.C: fix the broken test routines which broke
	  because THaEvData became abstract.  These codes are useful for
	  online scaler analysis as well as testing all features of the
	  scaler code.	Note, this has nothing to do with my upgrade (which
	  will not be checked in until I discuss it)

2004-10-13 15:03  rom

	* hana_decode/THaCodaDecoder.C: fix the comment that says I am the
	  author (I am not)

2004-10-06 15:07  ole

	* docs/: FAQ.html, index.html: Merge documentation updates from
	  Release 1.3 into trunk.

2004-10-04 19:03  rom

	* hana_decode/THaHelicity.C, hana_decode/THaHelicity.h,
	  src/THaHelicity.C, src/THaHelicity.h: Add SetState() method.	The
	  state of the object is defined by the mode (G0 delayed mode
	  versus in-time), the delay (if delayed), the overall sign
	  (calibrated by Moller polarimeter), the choice of which
	  spectrometer data to use for final decision about helicity (LHRS
	  or RHRS), and whether or not to check the consistency of
	  redundant data.  The check on ADC data was updated.  I notice
	  that for DVCS about 0.4% of data disagree between ADC and the TIR
	  I/O register.  Oh well, probably a delay issue, but not a bug of
	  the code, I think.  Otherwise the results look like before.

2004-09-26 17:25  rom

	* docs/output.html: Slight improvemente to string-to-double
	  assignment of EPICS data.  Although the strings that contain
	  white space must be in single quotes (the RF On example), the
	  strings that do not have white space may or may not have it (the
	  Yes=1 example -- Yes can have single quotes or not)

2004-09-26 17:23  rom

	* src/THaOutput.C: Regarding string-to-double assignment of EPICS
	  data: the strings that dont have white space can have single
	  quotes (or not), see ../docs/output.html.  Meanwhile, as a
	  reminder (and this has not changed), the strings that have white
	  space must have single quotes.

2004-09-26 12:38  rom

	* docs/output.html: update explanation of how to do assignment of
	  string EPICS data to double data in the tree.  Boy is this
	  tedious

2004-09-26 12:37  rom

	* src/: THaOutput.C, THaOutput.h: allow single quotes on EPICS
	  string variable assignment (but only if that strings contains
	  white space, if it does not contain white space there should be
	  no quotes).  See ../docs/output.html for explanation

2004-09-24 17:51  rom

	* docs/output.html: update the documentation about output, to
	  explain the new support for string EPICS data

2004-09-24 17:47  rom

	* src/: THaOutput.C, THaOutput.h: add support for optional strings
	  of the form epicsvar=4 which assigns an epics string variable
	  like epicsvar the number 4 to the output tree.  This was a
	  request of Bodo Reitz

2004-09-24 17:40  rom

	* hana_decode/: THaCodaDecoder.C, THaCodaDecoder.h, THaEvData.C,
	  THaEvData.h: Add GetEpicsString method to support analysis of
	  EPICS string data

2004-09-23 10:43  ole

	* hana_scaler/THaScaler.C: Fix warning about comparison between
	  signed and unsigned.

2004-09-20 20:47  rom

	* hana_decode/THaHelicity.C, hana_decode/THaHelicity.h,
	  src/THaHelicity.C, src/THaHelicity.h: In-time version of
	  THaHelicity, modernized to use ROC11 I/O register to obtain
	  helicity data.  Still some work to do to make this general
	  (in-time vs out-of-time, choice of spectrometer, redundancy
	  checks, etc), but should be good enough for DVCS experiment.
	  Out-of-time mode should still work by setting fgG0mode=1 in
	  header.

2004-09-17 13:31  rom

	* hana_scaler/scaler.map: updated scaler.map (contains DVCS
	  scalers)

2004-09-17 13:30  rom

	* hana_scaler/: THaScaler.C, THaScaler.h, THaScalerGui.C,
	  THaScalerGui.h, tscalgui_main.C: add DVCS scalers

2004-09-01 12:08  ole

	* src/THaAnalyzer.C: Make ROOT output file the current directory
	  before writing final output.	This is a quick fix for problems we
	  have when the input comes from a ROOT file as well (e.g. from a
	  simulation). This could have further implications ... to be
	  investigated. Works fine for now, though, and makes no difference
	  for standard analysis using CODA input anyway.

2004-08-04 09:48  ole

	* src/THaPrintOption.h: Add missing include of Rtypes.h (for
	  ClassDef macro).

2004-08-03 16:17  reitz

	* src/THaBPM.C: type in the comments corrected (checking my CVS)

2004-07-28 17:52  reitz

	* docs/bpm.html: Added Warning about sign ambiguity.

2004-07-28 17:30  reitz

	* examples/BPM/get_rast_const.C: Bug-Fix: user has to decide about
	  the sign of the raster corrections default values for the first
	  half of 2004 are given

2004-07-28 17:04  ole

	* examples/BPM/: beam_db.dat, check_bpm_calib.C, cutdef.dat,
	  get_bpm_calib.C, get_bpm_pedestals.C, get_rast_const.C,
	  harp_results.txt, my_first.C, output.def, test_tree.C: Merge BPM
	  example files from Release 1.1 into trunk (forgotten merge)

2004-07-19 18:06  reitz

	* hana_decode/THaSlotData.h:
	  can handle modules where the data from different channels comes
	  randomly ( = not sorted by channels ) - needed for CAEN V767 TDCs
	  it is still assumed that within one channel data is sorted by
	  time or ADCvalue and of course this one is slower and needs more
	  memory than the old one

2004-07-19 18:05  reitz

	* hana_decode/THaSlotData.C: can handle modules where the data from
	  different channels comes randomly ( = not sorted by channels ) -
	  needed for CAEN V767 TDCs it is still assumed that within one
	  channel data is sorted by time or ADCvalue and of course this one
	  is slower and needs more memory than the old one

2004-07-15 14:38  reitz

	* hana_decode/THaCodaDecoder.C: added support for Caen V767 TDC
	  warning: this TDC does not sort its rawdata according to channel
	  numbers, it is random roughly ordered by raw-time

2004-07-15 13:48  reitz

	* src/THaDetMap.C: added entry to support pipelined TDCs,
	  especially Caen V767 needing a reference channel (copy of common
	  start/stop/trg) to remove jitter

2004-07-15 13:45  reitz

	* src/THaDetMap.h: support of pipelined TDCs (like Caen V767) which
	  can only measure the relative timing between channels, but whose
	  absolute time relative to the common have a big jitter. Therefore
	  one channel needs to be a reference channel, which has a copy of
	  the start. In the decoding of the detector class this reference
	  channel needs to be subtracted, to remove the jitter of the
	  common start/stop/trg.

2004-07-15 13:36  reitz

	* hana_decode/THaCrateMap.C: added ROC17 with ten V767 TDCs for
	  BigBite DC as default setting:

2004-07-15 13:27  reitz

	* src/HallA_LinkDef.h, Makefile: added THaReacPointFoil

2004-07-15 13:27  reitz

	  thin Foil at z=0

2004-07-15 13:26  reitz

	* src/THaReacPointFoil.C: Reaction Point calculated from Beamline
	  and a thin Foil at z=0

2004-07-13 12:12  ole

	* src/THaInterface.C: Use new class THaCodaDecoder as the default
	  decoder instead of THaEvData, which is now an abstract base
	  class.

2004-07-13 12:10  ole

	* hana_decode/: Makefile, THaCodaDecoder.C, THaCodaDecoder.h,
	  THaEvData.C, THaEvData.h, haDecode_LinkDef.h: From Ken Rossato:
	  Modify THaEvData to be an abstract base class, and move
	  implementation of CODA decoder to new class THaCodaDecoder.

2004-07-06 10:27  rom

	* contrib/ParityData.cxx: fix small bug in assignment of profampr.
	  Actually was fixed on adaq computers awhile ago

2004-06-14 11:19  ole

	* Makefile: Add Calib and contrib subdirectories to srcdist.

	  Version is 1.3.0

2004-06-12 17:08  ole

	* src/THaOutput.h: Fix missing string definition.

2004-06-12 16:10  ole

2004-06-12 16:07  ole

	* hana_scaler/haScal_LinkDef.h: Fix link errors due to precompiled
	  STL classes on Solaris.

2004-06-12 16:06  ole

	* hana_decode/Makefile, hana_scaler/Makefile: Put OS version
	  defines (-DLINUXVERS etc.) into ARCH section, so we inherit it
	  from the top-level Makefile, except when STANDALONE.

2004-06-12 16:04  ole

	* hana_decode/swap_util.C: Add forgotten "using namespace std".
	  This is C++ code now.

2004-06-12 16:03  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCrateMap.C, THaEvData.C: Fix name clashes of
	  member variables with local variables.  (To avoid trouble like
	  this, just name your member variables consistently.)

2004-06-12 16:00  ole

	* src/: THaOutput.C, THaOutput.h: Move THaScalerKey class into
	  THaOutput implementation file. Clients have no need to know about
	  it.  Remove THaScalerKey and THaOdata from CINT dictionary. They
	  don't need to be in the dictionary, and their presence caused
	  link errors on Solaris.

2004-06-12 15:58  ole

	* src/HallA_LinkDef.h: Fix link errors with precompiled STL classes
	  on Solaris. This probably will break scripts that use STL strings
	  and vectors.	To six this, we need to remove all STL from
	  analyzer class headers.

2004-06-12 14:34  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: Fix portability problem (THaString is not a
	  close enough match to string on Solaris).  Also, remove unneeded

	  by local variables.  Use new name of #define of Ext_TRotation
	  extension.

2004-06-09 12:07  ole

	* Makefile, src/HallA_LinkDef.h: Remove unused class THaMatrix.

2004-06-03 10:57  ole

	* src/: THaCherenkov.C, THaShower.C: Only add positive values to

	  negative contributions from unsuppressed pedestals.

2004-06-03 10:53  ole

2004-05-11 15:16  ole

	* src/: THaBeamEloss.C, THaBeamEloss.h: First version of a beam
	  energy loss correction module.  A beam eloss module corrects for
	  energy loss _before_ the interaction (i.e. for incident

	  reaction (i.e. for outgoing particles).

2004-05-11 15:13  ole

	* src/THaVform.C: Skip deletion of formulas and cuts in Uncreate()
	  in case ROOT is not initialized, i.e. when running the TROOT
	  destructor.  Apparently, ROOT takes care of deleting formulas, so
	  those objects will be gone at the time our destructor runs,
	  causing a spurious segfault.

	* src/THaAnalyzer.C: Scaler and EPICS processing now deals more
	  intelligently with status results from preceding analysis.
	  Processing of events with fatal errors is skipped; a kTerminate
	  code is passed back, so the event loop is actually terminated.

	  corrections.	New class THaTrackEloss performs track energy loss
	  corrections and exports the THaTrackingModule API.

	  calculation of the electron energy loss   density effect
	  correction: use log(beta*gamma) instead of log(gamma),
	  consistent with PDB. There are probably other minor discrepancies
	  like this.  - Add material copper to ExEnerg().

	* src/THaExtTarCor.C: Call Clear() of base class in Clear().  Set
	  fDataValid at the end of Process().  Make Process() slightly more
	  efficient. In particular, no need to extract the track from the
	  tracking module since trkifo contains everything needed.

	  in branch names to replace characters which confuse TTree::Draw,
	  i.e. colon(:) and arithmetic operators (+-*/=).  They are
	  replaced with underbar(_).  So an EPICS variable like
	  slia:MV_AO_DXWID appears as slia_MV_AO_DXWID in the TTree output.
	  Also, there was a tiny bug that fEpicsVar needed to be cleared
	  up to its full size of fEpicsKey.size()+1.  The reason it is
	  bigger-by-1 is that the last data is always the timestamp
	  constructed from Unix time

	  as input for event-by-event beam direction information.
	  (Previously, the module always assumed the incident particle
	  momentum to be exactly along z_lab.)	Using this feature requires
	  careful calibration of the beam apparatus, otherwise the

	  This is cleaner and simplifies   implementation of extensions.  -
	  Add local variables for pointers to the lists of apparatuses,
	  physics modules, scalers, and PostProcess modules.  Handle
	  PostProcess	modules completely within the analyzer
	  (AddPostProcess).  - Implement the actual analysis in a set of

2004-02-19 15:50  feuerbac

	* src/THaVDC.C: Fixed a misunderstanding about the track-length
	  matrix elements. They are for a calculation to the transport
	  plane, not the (curved) focal plane.	Likewise, the matrix
	  elements are for use with the transport-plane parameters.

2004-02-17 17:54  feuerbac

	* Makefile: Add new classes for Filtering.

2004-02-17 17:32  feuerbac

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: A few changes:  1. Removed
	  EStage and ESkipReason 'enum' types, since they got in the way
	   of a derived class from adding more cuts. Likewise, kMaxStage
	  and	  kMaxSkip are now fMaxStage and fMaxSkip. The
	  stage-preparation has     been moved to the virtual method
	  'InitStagess()'

	   2. Added loops to initialize/process/cleanup THaPostProcess
	  objects, which
	      are used in the CODA event filter.

2004-02-17 17:27  feuerbac

	* src/: THaFilter.C, THaFilter.h, HallA_LinkDef.h,
	  THaPostProcess.C, THaPostProcess.h: Add functionality for a raw
	  (CODA) event filter output.

2004-01-27 01:36  ole

	* src/: THaCoincidenceTime.C, THaHRS.C: Use TMath::C only if ROOT
	  >= 3.4, not 3.3

2003-12-19 09:55  rom

	* src/: THaOutput.C, THaVform.C, THaVform.h: Work-around to an
	  apparent bug in TTree::Draw() that a THaFormula or THaVform in
	  the Tree cannot be Draw()n unless one also adds to the tree those
	  variables upone which the formula depends (so if formula=2x+y one
	  must add x and y or Draw() fails).  Note, the data are in the
	  Tree, its just that Draw() fails. I had already realized this bug
	  for formulas of arrays but did not realize it was a general
	  problem.  Easy to fix by silently adding all variables (not just
	  if they are arrays) to the tree.  We should eventually tell the
	  ROOT team what is wrong with TTree::Draw().  Note, this updates
	  the 1.1 release that has scalers and epics data, so probably not
	  compatible with ADAQ version.

2003-12-12 17:33  ole

	* src/THaRun.C: Print warnings but do not quit prescan of run file
	  if LoadData fails.

2003-12-07 16:01  ole

	* SDK/: Makefile, README, UserApparatus.cxx, UserApparatus.h,

	  UserScintillator.cxx, UserScintillator.h, User_LinkDef.h,
	  db_R.s1.dat, db_u1.dat: Initial version of the User Software
	  Development Kit.

2003-12-07 12:34  ole

	* src/THaAnalysisObject.C: Drop the requirement in LoadDBvalue that
	  at least one timestamp be present in the database file before
	  entries are considered valid. Database files without internal
	  timestamps are now simply valid for all times (within the time
	  period implied by the name of the directory in which they reside,
	  that is). This is the expected behavior. The prior behavior was
	  unintended.

2003-12-03 14:33  ole

	* src/: THaDetMap.C, THaDetMap.h: Minor code cleanup. Prefix
	  constants with "k". Make test functions static.

2003-12-02 10:59  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/: THaCrateMap.C, THaCrateMap.h: A half-step to a more
	  manageable cratemap initialization. The hard-coded init(UInt_t
	  tloc) crate-map has been moved to init_hc(UInt_t).  init(UInt_t
	  tloc) NOW looks for a 'db_cratemap.dat' file.

	  If it is NOT STANDALONE, the file is opened with
	  THaAnalysisObject::OpenFile to look in the normal directory path
	  OTHERWISE   it looks for 'db_cratemap.dat' in the current
	  directory.

	  If the file is not found, the fall-back is to initialize with the
	  hard-coded crate-map via init_hc.

2003-11-27 00:56  ole

	  THaInterface via ha_compiledata.h

	  bugfixes from Release 1.1.2 into trunk.

2003-11-25 15:15  rom

	* src/THaVform.C: two bug fixes:  1) various typo errors in
	  output.def could lead to array access violation / segfault --
	  array fVectSform is protected now; and 2) A variable like
	  R.cer.asum_c was interpreted as a prefix rule ("SUM:") -- easy to
	  fix by requiring the colon in SUM: AND: OR: prefixes

2003-11-25 11:38  rom

	* hana_decode/THaEvData.C: clarify the error message if cratemap is
	  wrong for scalers

2003-11-18 11:16  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/THaCrateMap.C: Explicity use TString::Data() to get
	  char*

2003-11-18 10:11  rom

	* examples/output_example.def: update the example of output.def
	  file.  Added scalers and EPICS data.	Also, one of the variables
	  had become a variable-sized array in the code development,
	  leading to a syntax error.  Fixed it.

2003-11-18 10:08  rom

	* docs/output.html: update the documentation about output.html.
	  New ability to add scaler and EPICS data

2003-11-18 10:07  rom

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaOutput.C, THaOutput.h: Add scaler and
	  EPICS data to the output

2003-11-18 10:06  rom

	* src/HallA_LinkDef.h: add class THaScalerKey (a small utility
	  class imbedded in THaOutput.h for organizing scaler data)

2003-11-18 10:05  rom

	* src/THaVhist.C: small improvements to ErrPrint

2003-11-18 09:56  rom

	* hana_decode/: Makefile, THaEvData.C, THaEvData.h, THaSlotData.C,
	  haDecode_LinkDef.h: Better handling of EPICS data.  Job is
	  relegated to THaEpics, public methods to access these data.  In
	  THaEvData, fixed handling of unitialized scaler slots (infrequent
	  warning is better than silent failure resulting in zero data),
	  updated comments on this in THaSlotData

2003-11-18 09:52  rom

	* hana_decode/epics_main.C: Test code to check epics decoding.
	  Similar style to the other *main* codes.  Compiled if
	  STANDALONE=1 in Makefile, otherwise ignored

2003-11-18 09:48  rom

	* hana_decode/: THaEpics.C, THaEpics.h: new class THaEpics to
	  handle EPICS data, replaces the obsolete THaEpicsStack

2003-11-18 09:42  rom

	* hana_scaler/: THaScalerGui.h, tscalgui_main.C: update xscaler
	  GUI.	The using-namespace-std line, and use L-arm instead of RCS
	  scalers by default

2003-11-12 18:03  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/: THaCrateMap.C, THaCrateMap.h: New method to
	  initialize the CrateMap from a TString as input (a long,
	  multi-line string) so the configuration can be passed in from
	  some outside database.

	  The format of the TString is the same as THaCrateMap::print's
	  output.

2003-11-12 16:20  ole

	* Makefile: Release is 1.2-cvs.

2003-11-12 13:07  ole

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: Various bug fixes and
	  usability improvements: - Don't terminate event loop on
	  CODA_ERROR, but actually skip such events   as was intended.	-
	  Open output file in Init(), not in Process(), so that the tree
	  and	histograms of THaOutput are created on disk.  - Don't
	  Write() the output file explicitly after the event loop. All
	  output   objects are already written by fOutput->End().  - Refuse
	  to overwrite an existing output file if fOverwrite is false.	-
	  Actually set the fAnalysisStarted flag.  - Add new methods
	  EnableRunUpdate() and EnableOverwrite(). Both already   enabled
	  by default, but can be reset through these functions as well.  -
	  Add Print() method. Currently simply prints info of the last
	  analyzed run.  - Add HasStarted() method. True if analysis
	  started and not yet closed,	so further replay will append to
	  the current output file.  - Fix incorrect test for overlapping
	  event ranges.  - Split off PrintSummary() function from
	  Process().  - Support different verbosity levels.  - Print CODA
	  event number, not event counter during analysis.  - New counter
	  nev_analyzed for "data" events (physics, scalers, EPICS)   as
	  opposed to CODA control events.  - Copy run object to local
	  variable after end of replay to save updated	 run parameters.  -
	  Allow only one instance of this object (since it modifies global
	  program variables, gHaCuts, gHaRun). Inherit from TObject.  -
	  Disable copy ctor and assignment.

2003-11-12 12:33  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h: - Remove "analyzed event range"
	  variables and replace with a simple counter of   number of
	  physics events analyzed. (The analyzed event range might not	 be
	  contiguous and so should be a list.) - Improve Print(). Display
	  nearly all info about the run, or just a   small subset if
	  "STARTINFO" option is given.	- Clear() only resets a subset of
	  variables if "INIT" option is given.	- Clear relevant variables
	  in Init() for proper re-inititialization.

2003-11-12 12:28  ole

	* src/THaRunParameters.C: Open database file with debug=0 to
	  suppress printing the database file name.  (This should probably
	  be controlled by a global gHaDebug level.)

2003-11-12 12:27  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: Minor changes to error/warning messages.

2003-11-12 12:26  ole

	* src/: HallA_LinkDef.h, THaInterface.C, THaInterface.h: Don't
	  allow access to gHaDecoder from CINT, but only through
	  THaInterface::Get/SetDecoder().

2003-11-12 10:20  rom

	* hana_scaler/THaScaler.C: another trivial fix.  The detector swap
	  was on Sept 15, 2000 but the bug had month=15, day=9 (at least
	  the year was right).

2003-11-12 10:13  rom

	* hana_scaler/THaScaler.C: If the scaler event contains nothing for
	  that crate, it is nonsense to process that crate.  Leads to
	  erroneous zeros.  This affected LoadData(THaEvData& evdata) and
	  was only noticeable during event-by-event analysis using
	  THaAnalyzer. Standalone codes which typically did not use this
	  particular LoadData method did not notice the bug.

2003-11-11 12:45  ole

	* src/THaOutput.C: Add missing initialization of fVar pointer.

2003-11-10 15:39  ole

	* src/THaRunParameters.C: Implement Print().

2003-11-10 15:39  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCodaData.h, THaEvData.h: Change CODA_ERROR,
	  HED_ERR, HED_OK values. CODA_ERROR and HED_ERR were clashing with
	  EOF. HED_OK should be zero for consistency with other classes.

2003-11-07 18:12  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h, THaRunParameters.C, THaRunParameters.h:
	  Add Get/Set methods for some of the new member variables.  Add
	  Clear() method.

2003-11-07 17:41  ole

	* src/: THaCoincidenceTime.C, THaHRS.C, THaRun.C,
	  THaSpectrometer.C: Add preprocessor conditionals to support older
	  versions of ROOT.

2003-11-07 17:38  ole

	* Makefile, src/HallA_LinkDef.h: Add new class THaRunParameters.

2003-11-07 17:37  ole

	* src/: THaDBFile.C, THaDBFile.h, THaFileDB.C, THaFileDB.h,
	  THaVDC.C, THaVDC.h: Fix compilation warnings/errors with
	  gcc3.2/RH9.

2003-11-06 17:44  ole

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: - Support new THaRun
	  interface.  - Instantiate decoder object (THaEvData) through the
	  ROOT TClass interface,   using the new global pointer gHaDecoder.
	  This gives the user flexibility   to use a different decoder
	  (inheriting from THaEvData) if desired, e.g.	  for analyzing
	  simulated data.  - Use pointers instead of references to evdata
	  and run objects.  - Get rid of global variable "nev" which was
	  used for debugging.  - Change the interface of internal function
	  InitModules() so we don't have   to pass in the list iterator.

2003-11-06 17:38  ole

	* src/THaPrimaryKine.C: Use new THaRun interface to get beam
	  parameters.

2003-11-06 17:37  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h: Extensive changes to support new
	  THaRunParameters class and to provide more initialization
	  options.  Init() now scals for prescale factors as well.
	  Update() function provides extensible method to extract run
	  parameters during replay.

2003-11-06 17:30  ole

	* src/: THaGlobals.h, THaInterface.C: Add new global pointer
	  gHaDecoder.

2003-11-06 17:25  ole

	* src/: THaVDCPlane.C, THaVDCPlane.h, THaVDCUVPlane.h: Include
	  ThaEvData.h in the implementation file, not in the header.

2003-11-06 17:21  ole

	* src/: THaRunParameters.C, THaRunParameters.h: First version of
	  new base class for storing global run parameters (e.g. beam
	  energy, target mass, prescale factors).

2003-11-06 17:16  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaEvData.C, THaEvData.h: Make HED_OK/HED_ERR and
	  MAX_PSFACT enums instead of statics to avoid numerous compilation
	  problems. Make MAX_PSFACT public.

2003-11-06 17:14  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCodaFile.C, THaCodaFile.h: Replace TString& in
	  member function arguments with char*.  Initialize handle=0.
	  Simplify constructors by using default arguments.  Return evio
	  status codes instead of generic CODA_ERROR where possible.

2003-11-06 17:12  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCodaData.h, THaEtClient.C, THaEtClient.h:
	  Replace TString& in function arguments with char*.

2003-10-31 17:49  ole

	* hana_decode/THaEvData.h: Include evio.h so that clients get the
	  definitions of the status return codes.

2003-10-31 17:48  ole

	* src/: THaAnalyzer.C, THaAnalyzer.h: - Put initialization into a
	  separate Init() method, which can either be	called explicitly
	  or will be called implicitly by Process() if necessary
	  (backwards compatible).  - Significantly expand the
	  initialization logic to detect most common   analysis scenarios.
	  Continuation of analysis (accumulating data from   several CODA
	  runs into one ROOT output file) supported.  - Save a copy of the
	  run object locally to be able to detect whether   analysis of a
	  new run is requested.  - Make interval in which event number is
	  printed during replay a variable.

2003-10-31 17:42  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h: - Add Init() method. Init() opens the
	  run file and uses the decoder   (THaEvData) to search for the
	  timestamp in the prestart event. Also   reads the database.  -
	  Add several status flags: fAssumeDate, fIsInit. If date is
	  excplicitly	set via SetDate, it is taken to be the run imestamp
	  no matter what the   CODa file says, and searching for a prestart
	  event is skipped in Init().  - Add several support functions, and
	  make some functions virtual for   more control by derived
	  classes:     ClearDate() - reset date set by SetDate()
	  IsInit()    - check if successfully initialized

2003-10-29 15:34  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h: Add IsOpen() method.

2003-10-29 15:01  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCodaFile.C, THaCodaFile.h: Add isOpen() method
	  to indicate the status of the file.  Ensure that old file is
	  closed if codaOpen() called with a new file name.

2003-10-29 15:00  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCodaData.h, THaEtClient.C, THaEtClient.h: Add
	  isOpen() function to indicate status of the file or connection.

2003-10-27 17:16  feuerbac

	* Makefile, src/HallA_LinkDef.h, src/THaAnalyzer.C,
	  src/THaOnlRun.C, src/THaOnlRun.h, src/THaRun.C, src/THaRun.h: The
	  THaOnlRun class connects THaRun to the ET-client. Developed by
	  Bob Michaels. To accomodate whether we 'know' the time/date of a
	  run, a THaRun object now has its date automatically set to
	  1995-1-1, and THaAnalyzer considers any date before 1997 as
	  unset.

	  THaOnlRun sets its date to 'now' (since the data is from the ET
	  buffer).

	  THaOnlRun included only if ONLINE_ET is set during the make.

2003-10-20 13:55  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h: Make comparision operators virtual and
	  non-inline (they are not time-critical).  Get rid of comparision
	  operators with Int_t to keep things general.	(Can always compare
	  run.GetNumber().) Fix oversight: GetNumber() now returns Int_t
	  instead of UInt_t.

2003-10-20 13:41  ole

	* src/: THaRun.C, THaRun.h: Make run number (fNumber) an Int_t
	  instead of UInt_t. Humans might  prefer it.  Define various
	  comparison operators.

2003-10-20 12:19  ole

	* src/THaSpectrometer.C: Reset TRANSPORT to lab rotation matrix
	  before setting the new axes. This allows
	  re-initialization/re-reading of the run database of the
	  spectrometer.

2003-10-20 12:06  ole

	* src/: THaSecondaryKine.C, THaSecondaryKine.h: Initial version of
	  secondary particle kinematics module (coincidence kinematics).

2003-10-20 12:05  ole

	* src/THaPrimaryKine.C: Initialize/reset data members to kBig
	  instead of zero.

2003-10-16 22:34  feuerbac

	* Makefile: Updated to include routines merged from rob_db branch
	  related to DB and Coincidence times.

2003-10-16 22:32  feuerbac

	* src/: HallA_LinkDef.h, THaCoincidenceTime.C,
	  THaCoincidenceTime.h: Merge from rob_db branch. Readout of
	  coincidence-timing TDC's and, using track-length information,
	  calculation of the time-difference of tracks from a set of
	  spectrometers at the target.

	  Generalized form to permit for additional spectrometers (eg:
	  BigBite) to be added without hopefully too much more effort.

2003-10-16 22:28  feuerbac

	* src/: THaHRS.C, THaHRS.h: Merge from rob_db. Define plane (s1)
	  that track-length is calculated to.

2003-10-16 22:28  feuerbac

	* src/THaSpectrometer.C: Merge from rob_db branch. Add track-length
	  and track-time information stored for each track.

2003-10-16 22:25  feuerbac

	* src/: THaScintillator.C, THaScintillator.h, THaTrackProj.C,
	  THaTrackProj.h: Merge from rob_db branch. Each track gets a
	  'THaTrackProj' object for each scintillator (and potentially each
	  outer detector) recording the intercept of the track with the
	  plane. THaScintillator contains timewalk corrections, and a more
	  complete reconstruction of the hit (y-pos based upon time, 'real'
	  time of hit at the detector plane, etc.).

2003-10-16 22:22  feuerbac

	* src/THaSpectrometerDetector.C: Fix (again) the use of cos/sin of
	  the rotation angle when computing the detector's x-axis.

2003-10-16 21:45  feuerbac

	* src/THaDetMap.C: More informative Print routine.

2003-10-16 21:44  feuerbac

	  compilers/rootcint better.

2003-10-16 20:53  feuerbac

	* src/: THaDB.C, THaDB.h, THaDBFile.C, THaDBFile.h, THaFileDB.C,
	  THaFileDB.h: Merge from rob_db. New generic database API (THaDB
	  class) and a file-based implementation (THaDBFile). See
	  THaScintillator for a partial example of how to use the API.

2003-10-16 20:51  feuerbac

	* src/THaApparatus.h: Merge from rob_db branch. Can get a const
	  TList of detectors.

2003-10-16 20:50  feuerbac

	* src/: THaAnalysisObject.C, THaAnalysisObject.h, VarDef.h: Merging
	  from rob_db branch. Changes to these files are:   - changed
	  VarDef's TagDef struct to use a void* as opposed to Double_t*
	  so different types may be read in. THaAnalysisObject::LoadDB is
	  modified to recognize the different types (only Double_t for
	  now).    - Added ReadComment routine to just read and return
	  lines that are      'comments' based upon the old-file standard
	  (space in first character	 means data, otherwise a comment).
	  Just for simplicity in parsing the	  files  ( can do  while (
	  ReadComment(...) ); to skip comments ).

2003-10-16 10:52  feuerbac

	* src/: THaTrack.h, THaVDC.C, THaVDC.h: Read the matrices
	  describing the relation between focal plane and target
	  coordinates a bit more flexibly. Also, permit reading in the
	  track-length matrix, and store the path-length information with
	  the track.

2003-10-16 09:21  feuerbac

	* DB/DEFAULT/db_D.dat: Added coincidence timing module listings
	  (ctimel and ctimer).

	* src/THaPrimaryKine.C: Bugfix: Actually use the projectile mass in
	  the kinematics calculation.

2003-10-14 14:58  ole

	* Makefile, src/HallA_LinkDef.h, src/THaElectronKine.C,
	  src/THaElectronKine.h, src/THaPrimaryKine.C,
	  src/THaPrimaryKine.h: Generalized THaElectronKine to

	* hana_decode/THaUsrstrutils.C: Improved string_from_evbuffer. In
	  addition to \n, also allow \0 to terminate the configstring.	We
	  should probably use the original C-code here instead of these
	  higher-level versions. Still, I thought I'd record it for
	  completeness.

	  function THaAnalysisObject::IntersectPlaneWithRay()	that

	  hana_decode/swap_util.C: Fix compilation warnings.

2003-09-10 14:32  ole

	* hana_decode/Makefile, hana_scaler/Makefile: Inherit
	  system-dependent compiler and linker options from top-level
	  Makefile unless compiled standalone.

2003-09-10 14:32  ole

	* Makefile, gcc-version: For Linux, determine version of gcc (using
	  utility script gcc-version) and define HAS_SSTREAM for gcc 3.x.
	  Split CXXFLAGS into CXXFLG and DEFINES that can be passed to
	  subdirectory Makefiles.

2003-09-02 16:30  feuerbac

	* src/THaBeam.h: Removed erroneous/redundant 'TList *fDetectors'.
	  The fDetectors list is already present in THaApparatus. The
	  compilers didn't notice the error, but after compilation with gcc
	  3.0.4 the THaRastered Beam code and the AddDetector method were
	  accessing different copies of the list. (?!?!)

2003-08-12 12:21  ole

	* hana_decode/: THaCrateMap.C, THaCrateMap.h, THaSlotData.C,
	  THaSlotData.h: Fix compilation errors on Solaris (scope problem).

2003-08-11 20:36  feuerbac

	* src/: THaBPM.C, THaBPM.h, THaCherenkov.C, THaCherenkov.h,
	  THaDetMap.C, THaDetMap.h, THaRaster.C, THaRaster.h: The THaDetMap
	  class and its child 'Module' structure have been upgraded to
	  include first-logical-channel number information as well as the
	  model number of the module. This removes the need for parallel
	  'fFirstChan' arrays. Also, a short list of model numbers (1872,
	  1875, 1877, 1881) has been included so a module can be tested to
	  be an ADC or TDC with the 'THaDetMap::IsADC(Module *d)' and
	  'THaDetMap::IsTDC(Module *d)' methods.

	  This removes the detector-map-listing requirement to have an
	  equal number of ADC and TDC entries. The THaBPM, THaCherenkov,
	  THaRaster and THaScintillator classes have been modified to take
	  advantage of these features. The model-number is always OPTIONAL,
	  and if not given the ADC/TDC determination is done in the old way
	  (ie: backward compatible).

2003-08-01 16:03  feuerbac

	* src/: THaScintillator.C, THaScintillator.h: Added global
	  variables for the number of _COMPLETE_ paddle TDC hits, as well
	  as a list. To ease studies of which paddle could have fired the
	  trigger.

2003-07-24 14:19  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/THaEvData.C: Default to setting run_time to NOW, such
	  that initialization of THaCrateMap works for ET-buffer data.

	  Also switch to doing a fixed-format printing of the VERBOSE/debug
	  information.

2003-07-15 16:49  feuerbac

2003-06-26 17:13  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/THaHelicity.C, src/THaHelicity.C,
	  hana_decode/THaHelicity.h, src/THaHelicity.h: Make certain to set
	  the q1_present_helicity after recovering from lost Qrt's. Also,
	  added more debugging on a Qrt-by-qrt level.

2003-06-26 12:57  ole

	* hana_decode/Makefile, hana_scaler/Makefile: Copy libraries to
	  $(LIBDIR) using cp -p, preserving mod time.

2003-06-26 12:57  ole

	* Makefile: Make $(PROGRAMS) explicitly AFTER making subdirs.  This
	  makes the build process thread-safe AND stops unnecessary
	  relinking of the analyzer even if nothing changed.

2003-06-26 11:56  ole

	* Makefile, hana_decode/Makefile, hana_scaler/Makefile: Another
	  attempt at a thread-safe Makefile.  - Subdirectory Makefiles copy
	  the libs to $LIBDIR - analyzer depends on subdirs explicitly, so
	  it never gets linked before	the subdirectories are built Also,
	  changed incorrect $^ in analyzer link line to $< (first prereq)

	* hana_decode/THaHelicity.C, src/THaHelicity.C,
	  hana_decode/THaHelicity.h, src/THaHelicity.h: Improved
	  determination of timing of the beginning of the 4-part Qrt, based
	  upon evt9

2003-06-23 11:49  ole

	* docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.txt: Add note that most physics modules
	  only operate on Golden Track.

2003-06-19 23:08  feuerbac

	* hana_decode/THaHelicity.C, src/THaHelicity.C: Removed the
	  stipulation that a Event 9 occurs at the beginning of a Qrt.	Due
	  to the signal timing, often the evt 9 came at the very END of the
	  previous Qrt, leading to the need for just-the-right timing in
	  order for the first-portion of the new Qrt to be recognized (and
	  it often wasn't).

	  So, to start a new Qrt all that is needed is sufficient elasped
	  time and a Qrt signal.

	  results in the case of only 1 element in the variable sized
	  array.  For THaOutput:  - Changed fixed-length char[xx] to
	  strings when building branch names  - Fixed the type information
	  to have the name of the correct branch when	 handling simple
	  types. It had been using the name of the last variable
	  processed, leading to inconsistent results.
